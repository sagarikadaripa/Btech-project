For solving the linear optimization I have taken the following example:-
The ABC company manufactures two types of bags:
	1. Standard bag 			2. Deluxe bag
If the company sells a standard bag, the company can get a profit of $10. 
If the company sells a deluxe bag, the company can get a profit of $9. 
How many standard bags and deluxe bags the company should manufacture to maximize, in order to maximize its profit?
